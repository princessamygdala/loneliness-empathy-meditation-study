##### Project Description: Loneliness, which has reached an all-time high in the United States, has previously been linked to reduced empathy. Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM) is aimed at extending feelings of love and kindness to others and has been shown to increase self-reported empathy. But whether LKM can reduce loneliness and whether this effect is driven by higher levels of empathy – including trait empathy, state empathy, and empathic neural responding – has not yet been assessed. In this pre-registered mixed-design randomized controlled trial, 108 participants were randomized to LKM training or an active control condition. Loneliness and trait empathy were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Empathic neural responding was measured in 54 participants during functional MRI by computing the multi-voxel pattern similarity between experiencing and observing pain, as well as fearful anticipation of pain. Both interventions similarly reduced loneliness, but not trait empathy, which failed to support the hypothesis that LKM is effective in reducing loneliness through promoting empathy. Furthermore, we found no credible evidence that loneliness predicts differences in empathic neural responding or state empathy for pain. However, loneliness was associated with lower trait empathy and state empathy for fear and pain unpleasantness. Together, these results suggest that lonely individuals are capable of simulating others’ experiences but may not subjectively perceive themselves as empathetic, emphasizing the potential of loneliness interventions that explicitly address maladaptive social cognition.
