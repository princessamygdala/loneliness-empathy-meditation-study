We checked in and asked if she felt the pressure increasing. At ~45 PSI, we went in to check that the device was correctly outputting 45 PSI. We continued up the ascending until 80 (which she rated as an 8 on the gracely scale) and then did descending starting at 80. When we started the descending file, she said the pressure felt like it was increasing and rated it up to 17, even though we were giving her descending amounts of pressure to our knowledge (steps of 5 going from 80 to 60). At that point we stopped because the participant seemed very distressed and it clearly caused her a lot of pain. Then, we did the structural scan, and then did study partner first. Then we went back to redo the threshold. She had a similar pattern of subjective rating where she rated many as 0 but it was a bit better now - when we arrived at 50 she rated this an 11 on the gracely scale. We went up one more step up to 55, which she rated as 14. We then took a 30 second break, started the descending file at 55, which she now rated as 15. We went down in steps of 10 now until we arrived at 35, which she rated as 13. This is the PSI we went with. First, we thought there was something wrong with the box but it turned out that the subjective pain ratings seemed to have caused this. We also think that descending will always feel more similar to each other at first and one does not notice the decline as quickly just because the subjective pain plateaus if it is high."
