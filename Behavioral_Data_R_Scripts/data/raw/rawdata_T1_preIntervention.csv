These questions will take no longer than about 30 minutes to answer. You may also be contacted for a brief follow-up phone call to determine your eligibility for later parts of the study.



We will compensate you with $20 via Amazon eGift Card or PayPal for completing the survey. 



We will then determine if you qualify for additional parts of the study. If you are eligible, you may be invited to take part in: 

	A 4-week online meditation training

We are different in terms of personality, politics, interests, and worldview, but still care about each other in a healthy familial way. I live near my parents so I go to visit them for dinner and holidays. We reach out to each other via text message at least once a week. My mother is very introverted and doesn't have a large friend group. I am the opposite, I am very extroverted and need to be around people to feel fulfilled. I think this was a main point of misunderstanding and contention when I was younger, but I now understand and embrace our differences.",4,"Extended family member - Uncle - I only see my Uncle about once a year during the holidays. I feel that we connect well because we are similar in terms of personality, politics, interests, and, worldview. All my extended family members are connected via a family group chat and the articles, jokes, and memories we share help to keep us connected despite the distance. 	",3,"Friend - Megan - I am very close with Megan, we have similar struggles, personalities, politics, interests, and worldviews. We both are profoundly affected by ADHD and are able to connect via our shared daily struggles. I feel that we are both able to empathize with each other and suppport/encourage each other in meaningful ways. Even though I’ve never met her in-person, I see her via videocall everyday in Focusmate.com sessions and other social videocalls (virtual boardgame nights and virtual manicure pedicure nights) ",7,"neighbor - I run into my neighbor walking the dog at least once a week. I make brief small talk in Spanish with him, but my Spanish isn’t perfect and sometimes I am too embarrassed to ask him to repeat things slowly.
